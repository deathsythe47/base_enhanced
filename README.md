# base_entranced

by duo and exar

a fork of sil's fantastic [base_enhanced](https://github.com/TheSil/base_enhanced) server mod

This mod is based on base_enhanced with some extra features

###g_sexydisruptor
0 = Lethal sniper shots with full charge (1.5 seconds or more) cause incineration effect (fixed default JK3 setting, which was bugged)

1 = All lethal sniper shots cause incineration effect

###g_fixsiegescoring
0 = dumb default JK3 scoring (20 pts per obj, 30 pts for final obj, 10 pt bonus at end)

1 = improved scoring (100 pts per obj)

###g_fixfallingsounds
0 = default JK3 sound (normal death sound)

1 = falling death scream sound for all trigger_hurt entities (such as death pits in siege)

###Proper ATST kills
When you run someone over in the ATST, you get a kill.

###Fixed countdown teamchat
No more spying on the enemy team during siege countdown.

###Fix Hoth first obj points
Bugfix for not scoring points on Hoth first obj.
